# Getting Started with attribut:er



## How to

You should set environment variables ``AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`` and ``AZURE_OPENAI_KEY``.
Then just run ``node <filenam:er>``, e.g. ``node frontendGen.js`` to generate form React component or ``node testGen.js`` to generate Selenium tests.

Use JSON file to let attribut:er know, which fields yor component should consist of. 
Even requirement engineers can write one.

Start example React app with ``npm start`` and enjoy this beauty.

## Limitations

Be aware of not deterministic behavior of the attribut:er.
